# Weight_Converter

We need to create a program in C++ that will ask the user to 
choose from one of those options: conversion from pounds to 
kilograms, conversion from kilograms to pounds, or the option 
to quit. We know that here are 2.2046 pounds in a kilogram, 
1000 grams in a kilogram, and 16 ounces in a pound.
If the 1st option was selected, enter a weight in pounds 
and/or ounces and outputs the equivalent weight in kilograms 
for up to 15 weights conversions. If the user enters 0 or 
a negative value, display the maximum, the minimum and the 
average of weight(s) entered as far (up to 15 weights conversions).
If the 2nd option was selected, enter a weight in kilograms 
and/or grams and outputs the equivalent weight in pounds for 
up to 15 weights conversions. If the user enters 0 or a negative 
value, display the maximum, the minimum and the average of weight(s) 
entered as far (up to 15 weights conversions).
If the 3rd option was selected, end the program with confirmation.
Create the algorithm in pseudo-code for each functionality, 
decide for the name of each function/algorithm, and decide for 
each name and type of your variables that you will need for 
those algorithms/functions.
 
Use functions for the subtasks and use arrays to save the entered 
and calculated data for up to 15 entries. Implements the function 
prototypes.
